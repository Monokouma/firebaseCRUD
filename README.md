Firebase crud is an app that I used to learn for create a fully functionnal app for register user signed them in,  and keeping them logged in.

You can register with a correct email and password then signed in with this credentials 
You have to chose a name and a picture in a set of four 8-bit user picture, all of this is stored and displayed in a dashboard on the main page
of the app, you can update all settings (email, password, username and profile picture)
You can also delete your account or just disconnect.
